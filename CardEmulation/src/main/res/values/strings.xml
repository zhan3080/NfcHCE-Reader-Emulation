Broad audience attention grabbing introduction.
We are IEEE DTU
Welcome to DTU. DTU is awesome. The Week ranks us 10th and India Today 9th.
Research, academics, placements, co-curricular exposure at par with IITs if not better.
The best ever contribution to the world of technology by an Indian, Intel Pentium chip, project headed and conceptualized by Vinod Dham, DCE alumnus. Jabong founder, ITC Chairman, Durjoy Datta, Sushant Singh Rajput (drop out), all DCE alumnus.
Introduction to IEEE.
Full form Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
Formed in 1963 from the amalgamation of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE) and the Institute of Radio Engineers. The members of the AIEE included some of the most prominent inventors like Nikola Tesla, Thomas Alva Edison and Graham Bell.
Worldâ€™s largest association of technical professionals with about 425,000 members in over 160 countries.
It is also a leading standards development organization for the development of industrial standards (having developed over 900 active industry technical standards) in a broad range of disciplines, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.
The IEEE logo is a diamond-shaped design which illustrates the right hand grip rule embedded in Benjamin Franklin's kite, and it was created at the time of the 1963 merger.
The IEEE includes 38 technical Societies, organized around specialized technical fields, with more than 300 local organizations that hold regular meetings.
